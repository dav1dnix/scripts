# gopls+goimports
Small go script that will install gopls and goimports because I am too lazy to install them manually.
It is assumed that this script will be run only once after installing go. It is handy for me because of my init.vim, which specifies that gopls and goimports must be installed (for linting, checking syntax etc in nvim).
