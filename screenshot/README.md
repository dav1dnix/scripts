## Screenshots an area and copies 0x0.arikawa-hi.me url to clipboard

## Dependencies
- maim
- xclip

- openssl (I think that comes with most Linux distributions anyway)

You could also rebind the Print key if you want to

## Support
Doesn't support Windows or ~~macOS~~ (could probably work on macOS as it is UNIX based, but I have no idea)
