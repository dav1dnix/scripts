## Screenshots an area and copies your domain url to clipboard

## Dependencies
- maim
- xclip
- sshpass
- openssl (I think that comes with most Linux distributions anyway)

You could also rebind the Print key if you want to

## Support
Doesn't support Windows or ~~macOS~~ (could probably work on macOS as it is UNIX based, but I have no idea)
