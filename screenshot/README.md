## Screenshots an area and copies your domain url to clipboard

## Dependencies
- maim
- xclip
- sshpass
- openssl (I think that comes with most Linux distributions anyway)

You could also rebind the Print key to this script if you want to, for example on GNOME you can do this: https://askubuntu.com/a/1039949

## Support
Doesn't support Windows or ~~macOS~~ (could probably work on macOS as it is UNIX based, but I have no idea)
